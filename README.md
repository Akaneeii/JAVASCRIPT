# ðŸŒ± My Web Development Journey  

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Safietou, a passionate learner diving deep into the world of web development. Hereâ€™s another course Iâ€™m following (after the HTML / CSS one) to sharpen my skills and build real-world projects:  

**ðŸŽ¥ Course:** [JavaScript Tutorial by SuperSimpleDev] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ)  
**ðŸ”¥ Why This Course?**  
- Teaches JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on projects.  
- Covers modern syntax, DOM manipulation, and mini-applications.  
- Perfect for bridging the gap between basics and advanced concepts.  

**ðŸ’¡ My Goal:**  
To complete every project in the course, document my progress, and reflect on key learnings. Each project will be pushed here with clean code and notes.
